# Windows-System-Administration
This repository contains several system administration scripts that I used throughout my career as a windows system administrator.

More specifically, the scripts aim at making the life of Systems Administrators easier by automating and scripting things that otherwise would cause some headache.

Some features include:
* Full preparation of machines and software installations after a clean Format.
* Network optimization scripts
* Backup scripts
* Connectivity testing scripts
* scripts related to KES and KES Network Agent upgrades
